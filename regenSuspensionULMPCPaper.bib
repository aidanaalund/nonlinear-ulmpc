  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has been extensively utilized in the automotive applications, such as autonomous vehicle path planning and control, hybrid-vehicle energy management, and advanced driver-assistance system design. As a typical model-based control law, MPC relies on a system model to predict the state evolution of the manipulated plant within the prediction horizon. However, a representative yet concise mathematical description of the controlled plant may not always be available in practice. Therefore, model-free strategies, e.g., identification for control and direct data-driven control, have been incorporated into the predictive control framework. Nonetheless, existing model-free predictive controllers usually require reliable datasets and employ complex nonconvex optimizations to identify the underlying system model. Furthermore, their control performances are fundamentally limited by the quality of the training data. Inspired by the model-free control, this paper proposes the ultra-local model predictive control (ULMPC), which is a novel and straightforward model-free predictive control technique with no need for the computationally-extensive model learning process. The proposed ULMPC is implemented for automated vehicle trajectory following. Carsim-Simulink joint simulations and indoor experimental field tests with a scaled car demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The basics of model-free control is now employing some old functional analysis and some elementary differential algebra. The estimation techniques become quite straightforward via a recent online parameter identification approach. The importance of iPIs and especially of iPs is deduced from the presence of friction. The strange industrial ubiquity of classic PID's and the great difficulty for tuning them in complex situations is deduced, via an elementary sampling, from their connections with iPIDs. Several numerical simulations are presented which include some infinite-dimensional systems. They demonstrate not only the power of our intelligent controllers but also the great simplicity for tuning them.},

The approach uses knowledge about a given route to precalculate a position-dependent energy-optimal speed trajectory using DP while taking information like speed limits, road slope, and travel time into account during the optimization. A simple MPC framework is used to control the traction force of the host vehicle such that the vehicle speed follows the energy-optimal speed trajectory as good as possible while ensuring safety-related constraints like distance to a preceding vehicle or speed limits. To show the benefits of the approach, a comparison of the energy consumption between the host vehicle and the preceding vehicle on the same route is performed. For the speed profile of the preceding vehicle, data from real test drives is used. Simulations show that the approach leads to a significant reduction of the energy consumption compared to the preceding vehicle on the same route. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the approach achieves high energy savings even with a poor prediction model for the preceding car. Moreover, the approach has shown to run very fast, indicating its real-time capability.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modeling driver steering behavior plays an ever-important role in nowadays automotive dynamics and control applications. Especially, understanding individuals' steering characteristics enables the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to adapt to particular drivers, which provides enhanced protection while mitigating human--machine conflict. Driver-adaptive ADAS requires identifying the parameters inside a driver steering model in real-time to account for driving characteristics variations caused by weather, lighting, road, or driver physiological conditions. Usually, recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman filter are employed to update the driver steering model parameters online. However, because of their asymptotical nature, the convergence speed of the identified parameters could be slow. In contrast, this paper adopts a purely algebraic perspective to identify parameters of a driver steering model, which can achieve parameter identification within a short period. To verify the proposed method, we first apply synthetic driver steering data to show its superior performance over an RLS identifier in identifying constant model parameters, i.e., feedback steering gain, feedforward steering gain, preview time, and first-order neuromuscular lag. Then, we utilize real measurement data from human subject driving simulator experiments to illustrate how the time-varying feedback and feedforward steering gains can be updated online via the algebraic method.},

CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data.

  abstract = {Model-based predictive control (MPC) describes a set of advanced control methods, which make use of a process model to predict the future behavior of the controlled system. By solving a---potentially constrained---optimization problem, MPC determines the control law implicitly. This shifts the effort for the design of a controller towards modeling of the to-be-controlled process. Since such models are available in many fields of engineering, the initial hurdle for applying control is deceased with MPC. Its implicit formulation maintains the physical understanding of the system parameters facilitating the tuning of the controller. Model-based predictive control (MPC) can even control systems, which cannot be controlled by conventional feedback controllers. With most of the theory laid out, it is time for a concise summary of it and an application-driven survey. This review article should serve as such. While in the beginnings of MPC, several widely noticed review paper have been published, a comprehensive overview on the latest developments, and on applications, is missing today. This article reviews the current state of the art including theory, historic evolution, and practical considerations to create intuitive understanding. We lay special attention on applications in order to demonstrate what is already possible today. Furthermore, we provide detailed discussion on implantation details in general and strategies to cope with the computational burden---still a major factor in the design of MPC. Besides key methods in the development of MPC, this review points to the future trends emphasizing why they are the next logical steps in MPC.},

The hydraulic component produces a large fail-safe baseline damping force, while the electromagnetic component adds energy regeneration and adaptability to the suspension. For analyzing the system, the electromagnetic component was modeled and integrated into a 2DOF quarter-car model. Three criteria were considered for evaluating the performance of the suspension system: ride comfort, road holding and regenerated power. Using the genetic algorithm multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II), the suspension design was optimized to improve the performance of the vehicle with respect to the selected criteria. The multi-objective optimization method provided a set of solutions called Pareto front in which all solutions are equally good and the selection of each one depends on conditions and needs. Among the given solutions in the Pareto front, a small number of cases, with different design purposes, were selected. The performances of the selected designs were compared with two reference systems: a conventional and a nonoptimized hybrid suspension system. The results show that the ride comfort and road holding qualities of the optimized hybrid system are improved, and the regenerated power is considerably increased.},

However, existing energy harvesting shock absorbers (EHSAs) compromise suspension performance for high-efficiency energy harvesting and being only responsive to narrow-bandwidth vibrations. In this paper, we propose a new ball-screw-based EHSA design -- inerter pendulum vibration absorber (IPVA) -- that integrates an electromagnetic rotary EHSA with a nonlinear pendulum vibration absorber.We show that this design simultaneously improves ride comfort and energy harvesting efficiency by exploiting the nonlinear effects of pendulum inertia. To further improve the performance, we develop a novel stochastic linearization model predictive control (SL-MPC) approach in which we employ stochastic linearization to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of EHSA that has superior accuracy compared to standard linearization. In particular, we develop a new stochastic linearization method with guaranteed stabilizability, which is a prerequisite for control designs. This leads to an MPC problem that is much more computationally efficient than the nonlinear MPC counterpart with no major performance degradation. Also, the effect of different road preview configurations on control performance is investigated, which is shown to have a significant impact on the control performance. Extensive simulations are performed to show the superiority of the proposed new nonlinear EHSA and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SL-MPC.},

  abstract = {A new kind of semi-active energy-regenerative suspension system is proposed to recover suspension vibration energy, as well as to reduce the suspension cost and demands for the motor-rated capacity. The system consists of an energy-regenerative damper and a DC-DC converter-based energy-regenerative circuit. The energy-regenerative damper is composed of an electromagnetic linear motor and an adjustable shock absorber with three regulating levels. The linear motor just works as the generator to harvest the suspension vibration energy. The circuit can be used to improve the system's energy-regenerative performance and to continuously regulate the motor's electromagnetic damping force. Therefore, although the motor works as a generator and damps the isolation without an external power source, the motor damping force is controllable. The damping characteristics of the system are studied based on a two degrees of freedom vehicle vibration model. By further analyzing the circuit operation characteristics under different working modes, the double-loop controller is designed to track the desired damping force. The external-loop is a fuzzy controller that offers the desired equivalent damping. The inner-loop controller, on one hand, is used to generate the pulse number and the frequency to control the angle and the rotational speed of the step motor; on the other hand, the inner-loop is used to offer the duty cycle of the energy-regenerative circuit. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate such a new suspension system. The results show that the semi-active energy-regenerative suspension can improve vehicle ride comfort with the controllable damping characteristics of the linear motor. Meanwhile, it also ensures energy regeneration.},

  abstract = {By simultaneously utilizing preview and global road information, a comfort optimization strategy which combines vehicle speed planning and preview semi-active suspension control is designed for autonomous vehicles. Considering that the impact of vehicle speed at the suspension vibration source is always a barrier for preview suspension control, a processing method for the road data is novelly proposed. Then, to utilize the processed data and to handle the nonlinearity of semi-active actuators, a hybrid horizon-varying (HV) model predictive control (MPC) method is given. The method can adapt to speed variation and meanwhile take the most of the road data within a fixed preview length. Further, based on the global information and considering multiple road irregularities in a driving path, a speed planning problem is established in the spatial domain and a dynamic programming based solution is provided. The final speed trajectory can compromise the driving time, vertical vibration and longitudinal acceleration. Various simulation results have been employed to verify the superiority of the hybrid HV-MPC method and the significance of speed and suspension coordination for comfort improvement.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear MPC framework is presented that is suitable for dynamical systems with sampling times in the (sub)millisecond range and that allows for an efficient implementation on embedded hardware. The algorithm is based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation with a tailored gradient method for the inner minimization problem. The algorithm is implemented in the software framework GRAMPC and is a fundamental revision of an earlier version. Detailed performance results are presented for a test set of benchmark problems and in comparison to other nonlinear MPC packages. In addition, runtime results and memory requirements for GRAMPC on ECU level demonstrate its applicability on embedded hardware.},
