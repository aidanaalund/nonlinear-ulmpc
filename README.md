# nonlinear-ulmpc

Some work I produced while a research intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Based on Dr. Zejiang Wang's ultra-local model predictive controller, I introduce a nonlinear component to control a simulated active suspension system. I also extend the concept to control a theoretical regenerative active suspension, a type of suspension that uses bumps in the road to harvest energy for the suspension actuator.
